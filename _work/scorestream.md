I did some freelance programming work for this local sports startup company. I was tasked to work on two prototyping projects. This was very independent work and meant I was in charge of my own time management.

The first project involved utilizing ScoreStream's API to aggregate data for all upcoming games across time zones and present users with a google form for selecting games of interest. The second project was a prototype website to mint NFTs on the FLOW blockchain based on user uploaded image data.
