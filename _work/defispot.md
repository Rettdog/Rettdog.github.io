During the summer after my first year of university, Keith, my programming teacher from the [League of Amazing Programmers](https://www.jointheleague.org/) offered me chance to work on this tech startup's website. He knew my background in software could be of use and I really appreciate the opportunity he gave me to kickstart my career.

The website was designed for users to exchange currencies, and my project was to improve the graphs and visualization of trend data. I worked both on front-end changes as well as adding functionality to the back-end to support more responsive graphs with new API calls.
