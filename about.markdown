Hello. I'm Garrett. I am currently a fourth-year mechanical engineering major at Cal Poly SLO. I'm interested in programming, robotics, and other technologies related to scientific applications of math and physics. I am also currently working towards minors in math and physics as well.

For the current academic year, I'll be in Sweden on an Engineering Physics exchange program. I'm exposing myself to a new culture while taking classes across a wide spectrum of subjects from medical engineering to applied mathematics.

I have over 7 years of programming experience. I took classes at the [League of Amazing Programmers](https://www.jointheleague.org/) throughout high school.
This culminated in me passing of the Oracle Java SE 8 Programmer I Certification Exam. I also have various levels of experience in many other languages. I am fairly proficient in Python and MATLAB as well, and I have done at least one project in each of Ruby, Rust, Typescript, and Unity. You can check out many of those projects [here](https://rettdog.github.io/coding-projects/).

Over the past two summers, I worked in various tech roles. After my freshman year, I had the opprtunity to work as an independent contract programmer for Scorestream where I prototyped some interesting software ideas, such as a Pick'em style event using Google Apps Script and Scorestream's API. That same summer I worked with one of my programming teachers from the League at Defispot. I got experience in both front-end and back-end web development. 

During my most recent summer internship at Yaskawa's Santa Clara office, I worked on a plethora of projects related to silicon wafer handling robots. I integrated the robot's commands and laser to take measurements of the robot's performance, wrote embedded controller programs to handle certain memory use cases, as well derived kinematics relationships between different coordinate frames and implemented microservice commincation to pass that information between internal utilities to better visualize robot positions. I learned a lot over those 12 weeks that exposed me to the rigorous coding workflow that many companies use today.
