Hello. I'm Garrett. I am currently a first-year mechanical engineering major at Cal Poly SLO. I'm interested in programming, robotics, and other technologies related applications of math and physics.

I have over 4 years of programming experience. I took classes at the [League of Amazing Programmers](https://www.jointheleague.org/) throughout high school.
This culminated in me passing of the Oracle Java SE 8 Programmer I Certification Exam. I also have various levels of experience in many other languages. I am fairly proficient in Python, and done at least one project in each of Ruby, Rust, MATLAB, and Unity. You can check out those projects [here](https://rettdog.github.io/coding-projects/).
