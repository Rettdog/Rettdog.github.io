Hi! I'm Garrett, a fourth-year mechanical engineering major at [Cal Poly SLO](https://www.calpoly.edu/). For the current academic year (24-25), I will be in Stockholm, Sweden studying abroad at [KTH](https://www.kth.se/en). In the fall of 2025 I will return to San Luis Obispo to finish my bachelor's degree and graduate Spring 2026.

My passion lies in applying computational tools to solve interesting technical problems, whether that be robotics, scientific research, or the development of medical devices.

In order to compliment my software skills and mechanical engineering degree, I am pursuing minors in both math and physics. Having these more theoretical and foundational perspective helps me tackle problems from both top-down and bottom-up. In addition to applying the well-tested models from engineering, I really enjoy the derivation process and the ability to be comfortable manipulating equations.

My passion for programming began in high school through the [League of Amazing Programmers'](https://www.jointheleague.org/) Java course. These weekly classes culminated in the passing of the Oracle Java SE 8 Programmer I Certification Exam. I then continued to cultivate this skill set through personal projects. You can check out the projects I've written about in the [Coding Projects](https://rettdog.github.io/coding/) section of my website.

During my time in university I have participated in multiple internship opportunities where I could test my experience against professional standards and continue to direct the development of my skills towards a fullfilling career. Descriptions of these positions can be found in the [Work Experience](https://rettdog.github.io/work/) section of my website.

I also have a [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/gkunkler) page that highlights my professional accomplishments. If you want to see more of my coding projects you can check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/Rettdog), but I don't update that too often.

And finally, while it isn't currently updated, here's my [resume](/assets/downloads/Resumes/GarrettKunkler_Resume_F2023.pdf) for a more concise viewing of my professional work. 

Thanks for reading!
